# 09_Developer_Profile_Generator
09 Homework - Node.js and ES6+ Developer Profile Generator

This application is for creating a command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username. The application will be invoked with the following command:

```
node index.js

```

The user is prompted for a favorite color, which will be used as the background color for cards.

The PDF will be populated with the following:

* Profile image
* User name
* Links to the following:
  * User location via Google Maps
  * User GitHub profile
  * User blog
* User bio
* Number of public repositories
* Number of followers
* Number of GitHub stars
* Number of users following

This application makes it easy for managers to prepare reports for stakeholders, by having up-to-date information about members of a development team. Rather than navigating to each team member's GitHub profile, a command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of profiles in PDF format.
